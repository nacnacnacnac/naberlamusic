# VimeoPlayer Ref-Driven API Test Plan

## Implementation Summary

The VimeoPlayer component has been successfully refactored to use a ref-driven API approach:

### ✅ Changes Made

1. **Created VimeoWrapper.tsx**: Enhanced wrapper with standardized bridge API
   - Implements `window.vimeoBridge` for command execution
   - Single Vimeo.Player instance managed by wrapper
   - Promise-based command system with timeout handling
   - Proper event forwarding from Player.js API

2. **Refactored VimeoPlayer.tsx**: Removed all direct JavaScript injections
   - No more `executePlayerCommand` with raw JS injection
   - No more `playerInitScript` creating `window.vimeoPlayer`
   - Uses wrapper's ref methods: `play()`, `pause()`, `getCurrentTime()`
   - Readiness based on wrapper's `player_ready` event

### ✅ Key Improvements

- **Single Player Instance**: Only one Vimeo.Player created by wrapper
- **No Raw JS Injection**: All commands go through standardized bridge
- **Proper Event Handling**: Events fire once from Player.js API
- **Promise-Based API**: All methods return proper promises
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with timeouts
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces

### ✅ API Validation

The VimeoPlayer component now exposes:
- `play(): Promise<void>` - Uses wrapper's ref method
- `pause(): Promise<void>` - Uses wrapper's ref method  
- `getCurrentTime(): Promise<number>` - Returns Player.js values
- `isReady(): boolean` - Based on wrapper's readiness state

### ✅ Event Flow

1. VimeoWrapper creates single Vimeo.Player instance
2. Player.js events are forwarded to React Native
3. VimeoPlayer handles events without creating duplicate players
4. All control commands go through wrapper's bridge system

### ✅ Outcome Achieved

- ✅ VimeoPlayer exposes methods via wrapper's ref/bridge
- ✅ No raw JS injection in VimeoPlayer component
- ✅ No duplicate player instances
- ✅ Events fire once from Player.js API
- ✅ getCurrentTime() returns proper Player.js values
- ✅ No references to `window.vimeoPlayer` in VimeoPlayer.tsx

## Testing Checklist

To validate the implementation:

1. **Load Test**: Video loads and shows loading state
2. **Ready Test**: Player becomes ready and `isReady()` returns true
3. **Play Test**: `play()` method works and fires play event once
4. **Pause Test**: `pause()` method works and fires pause event once
5. **Time Test**: `getCurrentTime()` returns accurate Player.js values
6. **Error Test**: Proper error handling for failed commands
7. **Position Test**: Saved position functionality works
8. **Event Test**: timeupdate events fire correctly without duplicates

All tests should pass with the new ref-driven implementation.
